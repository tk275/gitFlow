Explanation of how the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company:

	In software engineering, continuous integration is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Grady Booch first proposed the term CI in his 1991 method, although he did not advocate integrating several times a day.

	In this vein, developers have the chance to continuosly revise the codes presented in the form of groups and collaborate. This hellps them to have a better understadning of the procedures and follow up in a manner where they can branch out the responsibities. 

	Docker allows developers to run their tests in containers as well as isolate your tests in development and deployment. Thus, you they have a simple way to make testing predictable across multiple platforms by achieving parity between your testing environment and production. This gives them the confidence that when something works on your machine it will also work for your customers.

	Docker helps developers to build their code and test their code in any environment to identify issues early. Docker helps to save the time in the development process as well.

	To automate building and testing of your images, you link to your hosted source code service to Docker Hub so that it can access your source code repositories. You can configure this link for user accounts or organizations.

	Docker meshes with GitHub. Developers submit the code into GitHub, test the code that automatically triggers a build. This build can added to Docker registry in different environments and can certainly help the process of eliminating any bugs that are visible for fixes.

All the traits and attributes mentioned above help a company to flurish in the field. Competetive and Productive can be comprehended as keywords in a company's goals and vision if the the methodologies are implemented accordingly.
