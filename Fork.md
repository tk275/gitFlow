Fork a repo

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

Propose changes to someone else's project
A great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

Fork the repository.
Make the fix.
Submit a pull request to the project owner.
If the project owner likes your work, they might pull your fix into the original repository!

Use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.
At the heart of open source is the idea that by sharing code, we can make better, more reliable software.

When creating your public repository from a fork of someone's project, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others.

For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created Open Source Guides that will help you foster a healthy open source community by recommending best practices for creating and maintaining repositories for your open source project. You can also take a free GitHub Learning Lab course on maintaining open source communities.
