# mkdir

the *mkdir* command in linux allows the user to create directories (also referred to as folders in some operating systems). This command can create multiple directories at once as well as set the permissions for the directories. It is important to note that the user executing this command must have enough permissions to create a directory in the parent directory, or he/she may receive a 'permission denied' error according [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mkdir-command-in-linux-with-examples/).
