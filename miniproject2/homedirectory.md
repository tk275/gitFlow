# Home directory
A *home directory* is the directory or folder commonly given to a user on a network or unix or linux variant operating system. This directory is where the user stores all his or her personal information and files as well as login scripts and user information. For users more familiar with Microsoft Windows, this directory is similar to the "My documents" folder according to [computerhope.com](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/homedir.htm).
