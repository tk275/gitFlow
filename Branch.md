About branches

Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.

You can use branches to:

	Develop features
	Fix bugs
	Safely experiment with new ideas

For more information, see "Creating and deleting branches within your repository."

Once you're satisfied with the changes in your branch, you can open a pull request to merge your branch (the head branch) into another branch (the base branch). For more information, see "About pull requests."

You can also use a branch to publish a GitHub Pages site. For more information, see "What is GitHub Pages?"

You must have write access to a repository to create a branch, open a pull request, or delete and restore branches in a pull request. In repositories where you have owner or admin access, you can change the default branch. For more information, see "Access permissions on GitHub" and "Managing branches in your repository."
