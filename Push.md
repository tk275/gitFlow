Pushing commits to a remote repository

Use git push to push commits made on your local branch to a remote repository.

The git push command takes two arguments:

	A remote name, for example, origin
	A branch name, for example, master

For example:

	git push  <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME> 

As an example, you usually run git push origin master to push your local changes to your online repository.
